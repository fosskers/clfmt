#+title: clfmt

=clfmt= is a tool that lightly refactors your Common Lisp code.

It mainly aims to reduce extraneous whitespace and newlines, and avoids "being a
hero", leaving parenthesis management and sexp alignment up to the editor.
Staying simple keeps =clfmt= performant and nimble, compiling to a neat 200kb
executable.
